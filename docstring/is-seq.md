# (seq? form+) tests whether the provided forms are sequences
If all forms evaluate to a valid sequence, then this function will return _true_. The first non-sequence will result in the function returning _false_.

## An Example

  (seq? '(1 2 3 4) [5 6 7 8])

This example will return _true_.

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the '!' character. This means that all of the provided forms must not be valid sequences.

  (!seq? "hello" 99)

This example will return _true_.
