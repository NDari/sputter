# (assoc <key value>**) creates a new associative structure
Will create a new associative based on the provided key value pairs, or return an empty associative if no forms are provided. This function is no different than the associative literal syntax except that it can be treated in a first-class fashion.

## An Example

  (assoc
    :name "sputter"
    :age  0.3
    :lang "Go")
