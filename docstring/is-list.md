# (list? form+) tests whether the provided forms are lists
If all forms evaluate to a list, then this function will return _true_. The first non-list will result in the function returning _false_.

## An Example

  (list? '(1 2 3 4) [5 6 7 8])

This example will return _false_ because the second form is a vector.

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the /!/ character. This means that all of the provided forms must not be lists.

  (!list? "hello" [99])

This example will return _true_.
