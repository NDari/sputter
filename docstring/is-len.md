# (len? form+) tests whether the provided forms are counted sequences
If all forms evaluate to a valid sequence than can report its length, then this function will return _true_. The first non-counted sequence will result in the function returning _false_.

## An Example

  (len? '(1 2 3 4) [5 6 7 8])

This example will return _true_.

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the '!' character. This means that all of the provided forms must not be valid counted sequences.

  (!len? "hello" 99)

This example will return _false_ because strings are counted sequences.
