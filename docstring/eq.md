# (eq form form+) tests if a set of values are identical to the first
Will return *false* as soon as it encounters a form that is not identical to the first. Otherwise will return *true*.

Like most predicates, this function can also be negated by prepending the '!' character. In this case, *true* will be returned if not all forms are equal.
