# Sputter (a Lisp Interpreter)

Sputter is a simple Lisp Interpreter written in [Go](https://golang.org/).
Basically, it's just me having some fun and trying to improve my Go skills.
That means you're unlikely to find something you'd want to use in production
here.  On the other hand, if you want to join in on the fun, you're more than
welcome to.
